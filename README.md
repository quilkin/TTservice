Bluetooth low energy datalogging system.

This project runs on Android / iOS and will communicate with BluetoothLE dataloggers.
Will find, communicate with and downlaod stored data from dataloggers, then send resulting data to database in WWW.

Many thanks to Rand Dusing http://www.randdusing.com/2014/02/19/bluetooth-low-energy-plugin-for-phonegap/ for the BLE Cordova plugin

Source code for the logging devices, based on Texas CC2451, is stored elsewhere.
