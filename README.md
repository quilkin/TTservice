• Buttons for next set of expected finishing numbers displayed, to be pressed as riders cross the line ( so three or four numbers can be clicked in quick succession); finished riders removed from list automatically
• Actual times can be automatically recorded against rider numbers during quieter periods
• Possibility of automatically taking photos of rider's numbers after crossing line (in case of queries) – (this feature needs further thought to make it practical) 
• If 3G signal available, results uploaded to database at any stage at click of button
• Ability to be also used at club events, if list of likely riders already in database Web application to run on browsers on PC etc (also on iPad or other tablets )
• Functions for adding rider and club details

• Results calculated in real time, from web database updated by mobile app.
• Automatic calculations for plus/minus on Vet Standard
• Automatic calculations for team prizes
• Display format for projecting onto screen using PC projector at events

The above features are designed for use by organisers & timekeepers. Later, when sufficient data is in the database, a 'rider's app' could be made available:

• Compare times at events, check PB's, etc 
• Storage of recent best times for entering on entry forms
• Quick access to results online after an event

The mobile app and the PC app have the same interface. Both versions could be 'personalised' by allowing clubs to put their own logo on opening pages.
